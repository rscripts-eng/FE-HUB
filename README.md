script: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://bit.ly/FE-HUB",true))()

# Welcome to a Hub named jujutsu X!
our old name was supposed to be FE Hub, but now, we are jujutsu X, we have alot of scripts that nearly all executors support! this includes infinite yield, nameless admin, jujutsu X admin (infinite yield powered)
## What we do:
Many people complain about some exploits not working, lets avoid that, join our FE Hub then even the weakest until 60% UNC can execute scripts like this

## Our built in defender
We update our defender 24/7, blocking script detections, or patched scripts that put you to risk! or even PC crashable scripts, malicious scripts stealing passwords? in jujutsu X, no need to worry about that, since our defender is online 24/7
here, malicious scripts are not welcomed, we protect you even if we arent here
## Our sad news
Sometimes our defender gets patched easily, so we have to stay updated every 24 hours, or maximum 5 days, when patched we immediately update our script to the newest defender, so it can properly sync again


### Jujutsu X, Your scripts are safe.
